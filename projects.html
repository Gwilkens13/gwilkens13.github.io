                <li><a href="https://github.com/MIS-3033/exam-1-Gwilkens13" target="_blank">Project 1</a> - This project is from one of my exams in MIS 3033. For this project, we had to create an application where I was working for a marketing firm, and they want to be able to read in their yearly data about the top Halloween foods. I had to parse through a file to grab different halloween foods and filter them out and save the results as a JSON File.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MIS-3033/hwk-10---mvc-ef-Gwilkens13" target="_blank">Project 2</a> - This project is a homework assignment form MIS 3033. For this assignment, we had to create a MVC web site that will have information about IMDB's top rated movies. This site contained multiple pages and we had to use different ways to filter out results to change the page based on what was put in the URL.</li>
