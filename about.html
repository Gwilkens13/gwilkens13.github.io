            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Gavin Wilkens. I am graduating from the University of Oklahoma with a BBA in Management Information Systems. I am also currently working as a Store Manager for Rally House at our brand new Sooner Rose location. It has been a challenge working full time while also being a full time student but it has taught me a lot of good time management skills and how to balance out the stress between school and work.</p>
            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and spending time with my friends and family. I also enjoy going on dates with my girlfriend to do activities such as mini golf, arcade, and bowling.</p>
